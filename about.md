![Me (Recently!!)](/assets/author.jpg)

**Hello there!** My name is Vandy Liu, and I'm going to be a third year computer science student at UBC in Sept 2021. For the upcoming winter school year, I've decided to take it off to intern at some companies, which is what I would be doing if I were in the co-op program.

During my second year, I was a lead teaching assistant for CPSC 121.
In the summer of 2019, I was an AFE SDE Intern at Amazon Vancouver on the Step Functions team. I mainly worked on an internal developer tool.
In the fall of 2019, I will be working at Splunk Vancouver as a full stack developer intern on the Machine Learning team. I'm very excited for this opportunity and to learn a lot about machine learning.

My [resume](../Resume08182019.pdf) can be accessed on the top right.

Outside of school, I like to watch the NBA (Go raptors!), play video games and play soccer. Currently, I am playing Fortnite and a little bit of CS:GO.
