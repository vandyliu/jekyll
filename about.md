![Me (2 years ago though)](/assets/author.png)

Hello there! My name is Vandy Liu, and I'm a third year computer science student at UBC. 

Currently, I'm an AFE SDE Intern at Amazon Vancouver.
Previously, I was a lead teaching assistant for CPSC 121. 

My resume can be accessed on the top right.

Outside of school, I like to watch the NBA (Go raptors!), play video games and play soccer.
