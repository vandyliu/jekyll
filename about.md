![Me (2 years ago though)](/assets/author.png)

Hello there! My name is Vandy Liu, and I'm a second year computer science student at UBC. 

Currently, I am a teaching assistant for CPSC 121 and am trying to start some personal projects. 

My resume needs to be updated and cleaned up but if you want to take a look at it, there's a link at the top right. (It will be back soon!)

Outside of school, I like to watch the NBA (Go raptors!), play video games and play soccer.
